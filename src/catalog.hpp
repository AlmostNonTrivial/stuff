/*
** 2024 SQL-FromScratch
**
** The catalog is essentially an in-memory copy of the contents of the master catalog
** table, which contains data about other, user created tables.
** We want a version of this in memory because for each query we need to
** a) validate that a query is semantically valid, aka, does the table 'users'
** from 'select * from users;' actually exist, and b) how do we interpret
** the 'users' b+tree record format e.g., [u32][char16][char32][...], as opposed
** to literally any other configuration.
**
** If we didn't have an in-memory copy we'd need to do several I/Os on the master table
** just to validate a query in the first place.
**
** To build the catalog, we do exactly that, we first bootstrap the master catalog
** and then do SELECT * FROM master_catalog, and parse output to generate the catalog.
**
** We decide that the root of master_catalog always goes at page index 1. If it's a new database
** we'll create the master_catalog root, such that it will implicitly be placed at one. If it's an
** existing database we know to look for it at 1.
**
** Further alterations, like 'CREATE TABLE X' will directly update the catalog itself, but
** will also need to insert into the master_catalog table within the same transaction.
** On the event of a rollback for simplicity, we reload the catalog to avoid a more
** complicated sync mechanism.
