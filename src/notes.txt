TO CONSIDER:
// does        if (table->schema.columns[i].name.starts_with(col_name) == 0) need to do an exact match
// currently, if the master root changes we're fucked. right now we can handle 5 tables
// how do we actually initialise the btree on load, if we're not creating it
// i'm not sure if the master root is updated automatically by the vm
// the stl caused memory issues because I used memcpy and not the bloody = copy
// is two names nessessary? DELETE FROM sqlite_master WHERE name = 'Products' OR tbl_name = 'Products'
BUGS:
// unorderd map page_to_cache
// does embedded string in schema actually work fine
// parser will quietly fail and fuck everything
// master table needs compile which first needs schema

TESTING:
-- create index
-- delete from table to force merge (root change)
-- root table change
