- create master table might
need to put key in first column

- make sure the offsets are being
correctly set with the key or not

- do we still need to run the insert master
or can we just load the hardcoded version
as it won't change?

- how do we manage the master root changing
if we do it through execute internal?

- can our vm value be a 64 bit, 32 bit,
or string?
