- create master table might
need to put key in first column

- make sure the offsets are being
correctly set with the key or not

- do we still need to run the insert master
or can we just load the hardcoded version
as it won't change?

- how do we manage the master root changing
if we do it through execute internal?

- can our vm value be a 64 bit, 32 bit,
or string?


make sure to test the cached find in the containers

// arena
- do we want to plug in sort to use a string as the key for maps?
- for btree clear, we can do some a priori calculation based on t, as to
the max amount of memory surely


// what should I do about the keywords map?


// what are we going to do about to_string in reg allocator

// give "indexes_to_update" in programbuilder attention, and anywhere where we did
use map destructure iteration


// does        if (table->schema.columns[i].name.starts_with(col_name) == 0) need to
do an exact match
