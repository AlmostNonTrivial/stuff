- for btree clear, we can do some a priori calculation based on t, as to
// does        if (table->schema.columns[i].name.starts_with(col_name) == 0) need to
do an exact match
// currently, if the master root changes we're fucked. right now we can handle 5 tables

// Could we run the vm with a template output arena?

// how do we actually initialise the btree on load, if we're not creating it
