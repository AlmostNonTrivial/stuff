GENERAL:

- create master table might
need to put key in first column

- make sure the offsets are being
correctly set with the key or not

- do we still need to run the insert master
or can we just load the hardcoded version
as it won't change?

- how do we manage the master root changing
if we do it through execute internal?

- can our vm value be a 64 bit, 32 bit,
or string?


make sure to test the cached find in the containers

// arena
- for btree clear, we can do some a priori calculation based on t, as to
the max amount of memory surely
// what should I do about the keywords map?

// does        if (table->schema.columns[i].name.starts_with(col_name) == 0) need to
do an exact match


BUGS:
HOW ARE WE GOING TO RESULT CREATE Index needing the reference to itself
before the event can be read

DEBUGGING:
- ignore vm commands and master table for now
- for make record, and insert, the registers need to
be contiguous, should this involve the key



// currently, if the master root changes we're fucked.
// right now we can handle 5 tables
